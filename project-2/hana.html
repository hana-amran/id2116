<h1>Hi My name is Hana</h1>
<p>I am a product designer from the National University of Singapore. I enjoy designing new things and experiences for others. The design process thrills me and makes me very excited to come up with possible solutions for a better way of living. Other than designing, I enjoy long walks in the city, redesigning my room to make it as cosy as possible, exploring new home-decor stores and taking care of my plants.</p>
<h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Styling</li>
<li>Rhino CAD</li>
<li>Keyshot renderings</li>
<li>Observational skills</li>
</ul>
