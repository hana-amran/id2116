<h1>Hi My name is Hana</h1>
<p>I am a product designer from the National University of Singapore. I enjoy designing new things and experiences for others. The design process thrills me and makes me very excited to come up with possible solutions for a better way of living. Other than designing, I enjoy long walks in the city, redesigning my room to make it as cosy as possible, exploring new home-decor stores and taking care of my plants.</p>
<h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am good at styling. I have a good eye for what is considered ‘pleasing to the eyes’.</li>
<li>I can CAD using Rhinoceros</li>
<li>As well and render in Keyshot.</li>
<li>I am also a great observer which means I notice subtle things that people do.</li>
</ul>
