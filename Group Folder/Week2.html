<h3>Week 2</h3>

<p>Here are some of the daily items we considered.</p>

  <p> First, fluffing a pillow. We could use sensors to detect how much I fluff the pillow. Second, a book. We can use it to open or close and
    some form of music or light turns on. As for the watch, perhaps the detecting the movement of hand when checking the time.
    Using the humidifier, we can detect how much mist comes out. Or sensing movement of a mouse. Last option would be a spary bottle, similar to
    the humidifier, to sense how much mist comes out.

<p>Interaction Ideation</p>
<p>We chose a book as our daily object. We felt that there is several potential in making a simple book fun and interesting by adding unexpected interactions to it.</p>

<p>Sahrah: We choose to use the book as our object as for someone who tries to read whenever I can, people are always astonished to see me reading a book outside of school. The constant remark I get from people is "do people even read at this age anymore?". At a modern age where information is at the tips of our fingertips, reading doesn't seem essential to the young. Maybe the reason is because of the lack of interaction that one achieves through visuals or audio from a Youtube video for example? Hopefully, through choosing the book as our object, we could create an interaction which captivates one to even open a book.</p>
