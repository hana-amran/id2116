<p>After the consultation with Yuta, we realised that there's a reason the flow and placement of codes need to be sequential. 

Imagine the content of the pages, the song is encapsulated into the book "box".

This way, when we put the functional elements of the Book Object, it will work as it is.</p>

<p>We also learn to incorporate our microbit to p5j. Where there's a need to connect it via Bluetooth or connecting it with writing a serial line in the microbit. This simplifies the previous microbit code which was tedious and didn't work in the end.

<p> This week we tried another method to detect the opening of the book, using the light sensor. 
  Where when the book is close, there is no light detected and when open the light is detected using it as the trigger for the song to play. 
  This time, we were successful through learning how the whole system works; the javascript of the book encapsulates the function of play and stop through light transmission.
