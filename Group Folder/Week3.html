  <h3>Week 3</h3>

<p> Our chosen concept was to create a interaction where you open the book and an angel will start singing as if the book is 'sacred'. 
  We feel that it will be an unexpected surprise.
  In the video above, we use directional sensor to detect if the book is open or close.
</p>

<img src="image/Microbit .png" alt="images" class="center" style="width:700px;height:700p

<p> And this is the microbit connection we use to create the directional sensor.

  <div class="column">

  <div class="column" >

    </div>
</div>

<p>The image above shows the attempted turning of pages for it to detect east and west which translates to left and right. 
But as we were trying to play around with the arrows to see to what extend it would detect the flipping motion, we realise that the pages have to flipped all the way.
This was when we felt that we needed something more sensitive to work for the motion to be detected.</p>

<p>We also tried to include the angelic sound in this week exercise along with images of Greenland, depicting the earth and the image of Paradise to show reference to heaven or another dimension.
  This is the angel sound we intend to include into our object. So, the user will open a page that both of us has chosen and the angel sound will be turned on.
