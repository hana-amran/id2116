<p>I am a product designer from the National University of Singapore.
    I enjoy designing new things and experiences for others. The design process thrills me and makes me very excited to come up with possible solutions for a better way of living.
    Other than designing, I practice minimalism in my daily life, I love taking care of my plants and I enjoy redesigning my room to make it as cosy as possible.</p>

<p>I consider myself good at styling. I have a good eye for what is considered ‘pleasing to the eyes’ despite it being subjective.</p>

<p>I am also a great observer which means I notice subtle things that people do. I occasionally do people-watching and observe the interesting little things that people do.</p>

<p>I can CAD using Rhinoceros. I find it really satisfying once I get into the flow of cadding.</p>

<p>Rendering is my favourite part of computer-aided design. It is where the visuals come to life and I am able to communicate my ideas well.</p>
