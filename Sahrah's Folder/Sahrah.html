   <h1>Hi My name is Siti Sahrah
   <p>I'm a budding creative.</p>
</p>I wouldn't put a specific title behind the word budding as I'm still in the midst of finding what I'm truly passionate about.</p> 
</p>Somewhere in between the creative, I dabble between jewellery, bullet journaling and creating content for others in platforms.</p>
</p>By platforms I mean in the community of Sims 4 and Bloxburg through virtual builds and sim creation.</p>
</p>Hence, I do enjoy a game where I am able to transport to another dimension and escape the realism of society.</p>

   <h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Patience</li>
      <h2>Design work usually can be slow going, this Aldo means answers donâ€™t often come fast. So inevitably, It takes patience to let an idea develop, working on iterations and testing it out before getting to the result.</h2>
      <li>Curiosity</li>
      <li>Brainstorming</li>
      <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
    </ul>
