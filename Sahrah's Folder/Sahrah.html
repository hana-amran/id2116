   <h1>Hi My name is Siti Sahrah
   <p>I'm a budding creative.</p>
</p>I wouldn't put a specific title behind the word budding as I'm still in the midst of finding what I'm truly passionate about.</p> 
</p>Somewhere in between the creative, I dabble between jewellery, bullet journaling and creating content for others in platforms.</p>
</p>By platforms I mean in the community of Sims 4 and Bloxburg through virtual builds and sim creation.</p>
</p>Hence, I do enjoy a game where I am able to transport to another dimension and escape the realism of society.</p>

   <h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Patience</li>
      <h2>Design work usually can be slow going, this Aldo means answers don’t often come fast. So inevitably, It takes patience to let an idea develop, working on iterations and testing it out before getting to the result.</h2>
      <li>Curiosity</li>
      <li>Brainstorming</li>
      <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
    </ul>
